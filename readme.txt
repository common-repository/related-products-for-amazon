Allows to insert Amazon Associates Related Products widget.

== Description ==

This plugin adds Amazon Associates widget, which displays a one line responsive list of
product recommendations based on supported keywords. Keywords are entered within short code 
[amazon-related-products keywords="product suggestions keywords"]. This short code should
be included wherever the widget has to be displayed, for example within article body. In this
way you can boost your revenue generated by your content and targeted audience.
